# ðŸŽµ React Drum Machine:

This is a React-based Drum Machine built using Tailwind CSS for styling. It allows users to play drum sounds either by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keyboard keys.

## âœ¨ Features:-

- Drum Sounds - Click a button or press a key to play a sound.
- Keyboard Support - Press Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C to trigger corresponding drum sounds.
- Visual Feedback - Displays the last played sound name.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS - Modern UI with responsive design.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works:-

- The Drum Pads are generated dynamically from an array (Array.js).
- Clicking a drum pad button triggers the corresponding sound.
- Pressing a keyboard key (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C) also triggers the sound.
- The display updates to show the current playing sound name.
- The app listens for keyboard keypress events (useEffect hook in App.js).
